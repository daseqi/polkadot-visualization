This is mostly the same thing as the contents of this github repository: https://github.com/laboon/polkadot_apps

I cloned it, and have made some adjustments to some files when experimenting.

Make sure to checkout the readme if you have any trouble running any of these programs. Or checkout the lecture here: https://www.crowdcast.io/e/developing-apps-on-polkadot
